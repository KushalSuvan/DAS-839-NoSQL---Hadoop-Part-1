frontcourt Mullin apos s body began breaking down however and he began to miss significant numbers of games The Warriors had a successful first season with Webber but he and Don Nelson began to bicker

July August 2010 July 8 2010 Ideology Islamism Political aspects of Islam One ideology that plays a role in Islamic terrorism is the principle of Jihad which broadly means struggle Militants generally use jihad to mean defensive or retaliatory warfare against actors that have allegedly harmed Muslims Transnational Islamist ideology specifically of the militant Islamists assert that Western polities and society are actively anti Islamic or as it is sometimes described waging a quot war against Islam quot Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between Christianity and Islam dating back as far as the Crusades among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions Osama bin Laden for example almost invariably describes his enemy as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive Defensive jihad differs from offensive jihad in being quot fard al ayn quot or a personal obligation of all Muslim rather than quot fard al kifaya quot a communal obligation which if some Muslims perform it is not required from others Hence framing a fight as defensive has the advantage both of appearing to be a victim rather than aggressor and of giving your struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims Many of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and Israel An example is bin Laden apos s al Qaeda which is also known as quot International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders quot Most militant Islamists oppose Israel apos s policies and often its existence According to the U S Army Colonel Dale C Eikmeier ideology rather than any individual or group is the quot center of gravity quot of al Qaeda and related groups and the ideology is a quot collection of violent Islamic thought called Qutbism quot He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to pure Islam as originally practiced during the time of the Prophet The path to pure Islam is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the Qur apos an and Hadith along with implementation of the Prophet s commands Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical contextual perspective is a corruption and that the majority of Islamic history and the classical jurisprudential tradition is mere sophistry Qutbism An Ideology of Islamic Fascism by Dale C Eikmeier Retrieved 17 June 2009 The historic rivalry between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India According to a U S State Department report India topped the list of countries worst affected by Islamic terrorism In addition Islamist militants scholars and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as immoral secularism Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of pornography immorality secularism homosexuality feminism and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about them in his messages in his quot Letter to America quot he answered the question quot What are we calling you to and what do we want from you quot with We call you to be a people of manners principles honour and purity to reject the immoral acts of fornication homosexuality intoxicants gambling apos s and trading with interest You separate religion from your policies You are the nation that permits Usury which has been forbidden by all

com extra id 3D95001224 Extra WSJ com Opinionjournal com September 27 2001 April 25 2010 At no time did the Muslim jurist approve of terrorism Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism in Islamic tradition Muslims are commanded not to kill women children or the aged not to torture or otherwise ill treat prisoners to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities and to honor agreements Similarly the laws of Jihad categorically preclude wanton and indiscriminate slaughter The warriors in the holy war are urged not to harm non combatants women and children quot unless they attack you first quot A point on which they insist is the need for a clear declaration of war before beginning hostilities and for proper warning before resuming hostilities after a truce What the classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered is the kind of unprovoked unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations that we saw in New York two weeks ago For this there is no precedent and no authority in Islam But Bernard Lewis says Jihad is an unlimited offensive to bring the whole world under Islamic law Christian crusades a defensive limited response to and imitation of jihad From pp 233 234 of The Middle East A Brief History of the Last 2000 Years Even the Christian crusade often compared with the Muslim jihad was itself a delayed and limited response to the jihad and in part also an imitation But unlike the jihad it was concerned primarily with the defense or reconquest of threatened or lost Christian territory The Muslim jihad in contrast was perceived by Muslims as unlimited as a religious obligation that would continue until all the world had either adopted the Muslim faith or submitted to Muslim rule The object of jihad is to bring the whole world under Islamic law Bernard Lewis says Islam imposes without limit of time or space the duty to subjugate non Muslims p 73 of The Political Language of Islam quot it is the duty of those who have accepted them Allah apos s word and message to strive unceasingly to convert or at least to subjugate those who have not This obligation is without limit of time or space It must continue until the whole world has either accepted the Islamic faith or submitted to the power of the Islamic state Michael Sells and Jane I Smith a Professor of Islamic Studies write that barring some extremists like

in comparison to the Old and even the New Testaments whether its contents truly bear the quot widest meaning quot is a matter for the contention of theologians That he was made quot victorious with terror quot is undeniable given the tumultuous history of his prophetic career with its raids wars and assassinations quot Allah apos s Apostle said quot I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings and I have been made victorious with terror cast in the hearts of the enemy and while I was sleeping the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my

Prophet of Islam directed his anger ant the Jewish poet Ka b bin Al Ashraf who according to Ibn Ishaq quot composed amatory verses of an insulting nature about the Muslim women quot The Prophet said quot Who is ready to kill Ka apos b bin Al Ashraf who has really hurt Allah and His Apostle quot Muhammad bin Maslama said quot O Allah apos s Apostle Do you like me to kill him quot He replied in the affirmative So Muhammad bin Maslama went to him i e Ka apos b and said quot This person i e the Prophet has put us to task and asked us for charity quot Ka apos b replied quot By Allah you will get

Muslim women and children could legitimately suffer the fate of male unbelievers The Prophet passed by me at a place called Al Abwa or Waddan and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger The Prophet replied quot They i e women and children are from them i e pagans quot I also heard the Prophet saying quot The institution of Hima is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle Narrated As Sab bin Jaththama Volume 4 Book 52 Number 256 Criticism of Islamic terrorist ideology Although quot Islamic

grounds has also been made by Abdal Hakim Murad Timothy Winter Certainly neither bin Laden nor his principal associate Ayman al Zawahiri are graduates of Islamic universities And so their proclamations ignore 14 centuries of Muslim scholarship and instead take the form of lists of anti American grievances and of Koranic quotations referring to early Muslim wars against Arab idolaters These are followed by the conclusion that all Americans civilian and military are to be wiped off the face of the Earth All this amounts to an odd and extreme violation of the normal methods of

Some contemporary scholars who have followed a textual based approach to the study of the Qur apos an with an emphasis over the coherence in the Book and the context of situation offered a radical interpretation on the verses and prophetic narratives that are usually quoted by the militants to promote militancy According to Javed Ahmad Ghamidi his booklet on Jihad is considered one of his most important contribution towards understanding the religion according to the principles of interpreting the Qur apos an introduced by Farahi and Islahi the Qur apos an does not allow waging war except for against oppression under a sovereign state He holds that jihad without a state is nothing but creating nuisance in the land when hijacked by the individuals and groups independent of the state authority defeats the purpose The principle behind this study of the issue in the basic sources is the principle that there are divine injunctions in the Qur apos an which are specific to the age of the Messenger He says that nobody can be punished for apostasy or being non Muslim after the Prophet who acted as the divine agent when he punished the disbelievers by sword who had rejected the message of God and his messenger even after the truth was made manifest to them Ghamidi and his associates have written extensively on the topics related to these issues In his book Meezan Ghamidi has concluded that Jihad can only waged against persecution Islamic jihad has only two purposes putting an end to persecution even that of the non Muslims and making the religion of Islam reign supreme in the Arabian peninsula The latter type was specific for the messenger of God and is no more operative Under a sovereign state There are strict ethical limits for jihad which do not again allow fighting for example non combatants Seen in this perspective acts of terrorism including suicide bombing becomes prohibited Opinion surveys April 2010 Gallup conducted tens of thousands of hour long face to face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries between 2001 and 2007 It found that contrary to the prevailing perception in the west that the actions of al Qaeda enjoy

Renaissance Cathedral of Lima is a legacy of the Spanish settlement in that city The Spanish language now the second most widely spoken language in the world and the Roman Catholic faith were brought to America parts of Africa and the Spanish East Indies by Spanish colonization which began in the 15th century It also played a crucial part in sustaining the Catholic Church as the leading Christian denomination in Europe when it was under extreme pressure The long colonial period in Spanish America resulted in a mixing of peoples Most Hispanics in the Americas have mixed indigenous and European ancestry while a substantial proportion also have African ancestry The only exceptions are Argentina Chile and Uruguay which experienced heavy European immigration in the post colonial period In concert with the Portuguese Empire the Spanish Empire laid the foundations of a truly global trade by opening up the great trans oceanic trade routes The Spanish Dollar became the world apos s first global currency One of the features of this trade was the exchange of a great array of domesticated plants and animals between the Old World and the New and vice versa Some that were introduced to America included wheat barley apples cattle sheep pigs horses donkeys and many others The Old World received from America such things as maize potatoes chili peppers tomatoes tobacco beans squash cacao chocolate vanilla avocados pineapples chewing gum rubber peanuts cashews brazil nuts pecans blueberries strawberries quinoa amaranth chia and agave The result of these exchanges was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not only in America but also that of Europe and Asia There were also cultural influences which can be seen in everything from architecture to food music art and law from Southern Argentina and Chile to the Southwest United States The complex origins and contacts of different peoples resulted in cultural influences coming together in the varied forms so evident today in the former colonial areas See also History of Spain List of Spanish wars Panhispanism Spanish Guinea Imperator totius Hispaniae List of largest empires References Notes 30em

episode quot Whacking Day quot Chalmers is a strict and largely humorless man with a short temper and low tolerance for disorder or rule breaking his general manner and personality are like those of a military officer Whenever he visits Springfield Elementary some sort of disaster strikes He produces extreme anxiety in Principal Skinner who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening He is also known for seeming to be in complete disbelief of these improbable stories but ultimately winds up actually believing them teasing Skinner and the audience that he may actually take some action Chalmers is known for throwing open the doors to the room and bellowing quot SKIN NER quot or quot SEY MOUR quot to which Seymour stammers quot S Superintendent Chalmers quot His catchphrase has caused some paranoia in Skinner as seen in quot Lisa apos s Date with Density quot On a few occasions he says Skinner apos s name this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong

unconcerned with the school apos s decline saying that quot the way America apos s public schools are sliding they apos ll all be like this in a matter of months I say enjoy it it apos s a hell of a toboggan ride quot He also promotes people based on personal bias as opposed to actual competence promoting Principal Holloway described by Skinner as a quot drunk quot and by Chalmers as a quot pill
